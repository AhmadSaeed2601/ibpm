\title{Design document for Immersed Boundary Projection Method (IBPM)}
\author{Clancy Rowley}
\date{\revisioninfo}
\maketitle

\section{Purpose of this document}
This document describes the high-level design of a code to implement the Immersed Boundary Projection Method (IBPM) of Colonius and Taira \cite{ColTai-07}.  Here we give a high-level overview of the classes planned, interactions between them, and their public interfaces.  Where appropriate, we describe ideas for possible implementations, but for the most part we leave implementation to the detailed class design.

This document is {\em not} intended to be a ``living'' document that evolves as changes are made to the code (although such modifications would of course be appropriate should major changes or additions to the code be undertaken).  The intent is for the ``living'' documentation to be contained within the code itself, to be extracted using Doxygen.

\section{Classes}
Here is a description of classes.
